! What is Virtual DOM in React JS and why is it necessary?

- Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of Real DOM
- React update the state changes in Virtual DOM first and then it syncs with Real DOM

1. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is re-rendered in the virtual DOM view. 
2. The difference between the previous DOM representation and the new one is then calculated.
3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will only be updated with what has really changed.

- Virtual DOM makes the performance faster, not because the processing itself is done in less time.The reason is the amount of changed information â€“ rather than wasting time on updating the entire page, you can dissect it into small elements and interactions
